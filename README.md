#  Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes both a machine learning approach (Logistic Regression) and a rule-based sentiment analyzer (VADER), along with an interactive Streamlit dashboard for user testing and visualization.

---

##  Objective

To build a system that can classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments using:
- Text preprocessing
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Logistic Regression model
- Rule-based VADER analyzer for comparison
- Streamlit dashboard for live user interaction

##  How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-movie-reviews.git
cd sentiment-analysis-movie-reviews


### 2. Install Required Libraries

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Run the Model Training Script

bash
python main.py


This will:
- Preprocess the review text
- Train a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF features
- Evaluate and print accuracy and classification report
- Save the trained model and vectorizer to the models/ folder

### 4. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard

bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py


This dashboard lets you:
- View sentiment distribution using VADER
- Generate a word cloud from reviews
- Enter your own review and get real-time sentiment feedback

---

##  Methodology

- Used NLTK for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numeric form
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier for supervised sentiment analysis
- Integrated NLTKâ€™s VADER for rule-based sentiment prediction
- Built an interactive Streamlit app for visualization and testing

---

##  Features in Dashboard

-  Sentiment distribution chart using VADER
-  Word cloud of top review words
-  Live review box for custom sentiment prediction

---

##  Technologies Stack

- Python  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, WordCloud  
- Streamlit
